          <h3>The Differences between UK and Indian Education</h3>
          <h4>Education in India</h4>
          <h4>SSC</h4>
          <p>The Secondary School Certificate is a public examination taken by students after completing at least ten years of schooling in the following subjects: languages (English & 1 Regional Language), Social Studies (SST), Mathematics, and Science (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology).</p>
          <p>A new 9-point grading system has been introduced for this level: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D, E1, E2.</p>
          <h4>HSC</h4>
          <p>The Higher Secondary Certificate is a two-year study in science, commerce, and arts at a school. Results are awarded in percentages as below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Distinction – 75%+</li>
            <li>First Class – 60%</li>
            <li>Second Class – 50%</li>
            <li>Pass – 33%</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Bachelor’s Degree in India</h4>
          <p>This involves 3/4 years of study in a university with specialisation in an area like Commerce and Economics, Management, Computing, Arts, Engineering, or Science.</p>
          <p>Degrees are awarded as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Distinction</li>
            <li>First Class</li>
            <li>Second Class</li>
            <li>Pass</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Education in the UK</h4>
          <h4>GCSE</h4>
          <p>General Certificate of Secondary Education: Level 2 of the NQF Framework for GCSEs grades A* – C. Students can take up to 9-12 GCSEs, including English and Maths, at A*- C.</p>
          <p>GCSEs are available in over 40 academic and nine ‘applied’ subjects. The applied subjects are focused on wider work areas, such as engineering. When you take GCSEs, you can achieve pass grades from A* to G. If you don’t achieve the minimum pass mark to get a grade G, then a U grade is awarded, which means ‘unclassified’.</p>
          <p>Higher tier (difficult level) exams lead to grades A* – D</p>
          <p>Foundation tier exams lead to grades C – G</p>
          <h4>A-Levels</h4>
          <p>A-levels comprise the AS (advanced subsidiary) level and the A2. Each year’s grade makes up 50 per cent of the overall A-level grade. This forms level 3 of the NQF qualifications framework.</p>
          <p><strong>Year 1: AS-Level</strong>—Students can study the AS-Level as either a free-standing qualification or the first half of the full A-level.</p>
          <p><strong>Year 2: A2</strong>—In year two of study, you take the A2 – this is not a separate qualification, but the second half of the A-Level. The A2 is designed to deepen the knowledge you gained during the AS Level.</p>
          <p>Colleges of further education and sixth-form colleges also offer academic, technical and vocational courses for people over 16.</p>
          <p>Students can also choose to take the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma. This programme is an internationally recognised qualification for students aged 16 to 19. It is level 3 of the NQF qualifications framework and is focused on studying various subjects, including languages, science, maths, history, arts and geography.</p>
          <h4>Undergraduate UK Study</h4>
          <p><strong>Universities and Colleges Admission Service (UCAS)</strong></p>
          <p>UCAS manages applications to higher education courses in the UK and processes more than two million applications for full-time undergraduate courses yearly. StudyIn uses UCAS for undergraduate applications on behalf of Indian students.</p>
          <p><strong>Foundation Study in the UK</strong></p>
          <p>Students can opt to study a Foundation Degree (Level 5 of the FHEQ / NQF qualifications framework), a university-level qualification involving the first two years of an honours degree. Upon obtaining a Foundation Degree, students may ‘top-up’ their qualification to an honours degree.</p>
          <p>Undergraduate studies in the UK take three years to complete in most cases, leading to a qualification such as a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or a Bachelor of Science (BSc) – level 6 of NQF/ FHEQ. You will need at least four years of study if you choose a sandwich programme involving practical work accompanied by coursework.</p>

          <h4>Undergraduate Study in India</h4>
          <p>After completing 12 years of education, students can apply for undergraduate degrees at universities or colleges. Undergraduate study in India typically consists of a 3-year Bachelor’s degree and a 4-year programme for a professional degree, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) or a Bachelor of Medicine or a Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS).</p>
          <p>Admission is based on the student’s performance in their final secondary school examinations, such as the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) or the Indian School Certificate (ISC). Some courses may have additional entrance exams or require minimum grades in specific subjects.</p>
          <h4>Postgraduate UK Study</h4>
          <p><strong>Master’s Study</strong></p>
          <p>After completing an undergraduate degree, students can study for a postgraduate diploma, postgraduate certificate or the more traditional Master’s degree. Different types of postgraduate degrees include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MA: Master of Arts</li>
            <li>MSc: Master of Science</li>
            <li>MBA: Master of Business Administration</li>
            <li>LLM: Master of Laws</li>
            <li>MEd: Master of Education</li>
            <li>MPhil: Master of Philosophy</li>
            <li>MRes: Master of Research</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Grades are normally awarded as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Distinction</li>
            <li>Merit</li>
            <li>Pass</li>
            <li>Fail</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Doctorates/PhD</strong></p>
          <p>A doctorate qualification or Research degree (Level 8 of the NQF/ FHEQ qualifications framework) allows you to undertake an original piece of research. Completing a PhD usually takes at least three years of full-time study. Doctorates are normally awarded as either a pass or fail, sometimes with distinction.</p>
          <h4>Postgraduate Study in India</h4>
          <p><strong>Master’s Study</strong></p>
          <p>Postgraduate study in India typically consists of a two-year Master’s degree and a three-year professional degree, such as a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or a Master of Technology (M.Tech).</p>
          <p>To be eligible for postgraduate study, students must have completed an undergraduate degree from a recognised university or college in India. Admissions to postgraduate courses is based on the student’s performance in their undergraduate degree and their scores on entrance exams like the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) for technical courses or the Common Admission Test (CAT) for management programmes.</p>
          <p><strong>Doctorates/PhD</strong></p>
          <p>A PhD in India typically takes 3-5 years to complete, depending on the field of study and the candidate’s research progress. To be eligible for a PhD in India, a student must have completed a Master’s degree from a recognised university or college. PhD students are typically required to submit a thesis or dissertation representing their original research and making a significant contribution to their field of study.</p>
          <h4>Education in Scotland</h4>
          <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) provides syllabuses for years S3-S6 in secondary school. “Standard Grade” courses are taken by students, including studying years S3-S4. These are equivalent to the Indian SSC – 10th STD and the UK’s GCSE levels.</p>
          <p>Grades range from 1 (highest) to 7 (lowest). Grade 3 and above is considered a pass.</p>
          <p>Years S5 and S6 are 1-year courses, harder than GCSEs but easier than A-Levels. Therefore, some feel these courses are insufficient training for university, so Scottish university degrees generally last for one more year than English universities.</p>
          <p>Grades range from A (highest) to C, which is a pass, and D, which is a near pass.</p>
          <p>The Advanced Higher is taken by the ablest S6 students, where students focus on one or two subjects. These papers are graded A-E with credit values similar to A-Level in the UK.</p>
