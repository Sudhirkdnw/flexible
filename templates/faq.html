            <li>Distinction – 75%+</li>
            <li>First Class – 60%</li>
            <li>Second Class – 50%</li>
            <li>Pass – 33%</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Bachelor’s Degree in India</h4>

          <p>GCSEs are available in over 40 academic and nine ‘applied’ subjects. The applied subjects are focused on wider work areas, such as engineering. When you take GCSEs, you can achieve pass grades from A* to G. If you don’t achieve the minimum pass mark to get a grade G, then a U grade is awarded, which means ‘unclassified’.</p>
          <p>Higher tier (difficult level) exams lead to grades A* – D</p>
          <p>Foundation tier exams lead to grades C – G</p>
          <h4>A-Levels</h4>
          <p>A-levels comprise the AS (advanced subsidiary) level and the A2, delivered online with interactive lessons and live doubt sessions. Each year’s grade makes up 50 per cent of the overall A-level grade. This forms level 3 of the NQF qualifications framework.</p>
          <p><strong>Year 1: AS-Level</strong>—Students can study the AS-Level as either a free-standing qualification or the first half of the full A-level, with live tutor support.</p>
          <p><strong>Year 2: A2</strong>—In year two, students take the A2, deepening knowledge gained during the AS Level, supported by online resources and live sessions.</p>
          <p>Colleges of further education and sixth-form colleges also offer academic, technical, and vocational courses for people over 16, which we provide online.</p>
          <p>Students can also choose to take the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma online, an internationally recognised qualification for students aged 16 to 19, covering subjects like languages, science, maths, history, arts, and geography.</p>
